# cloudflare-transfer

**cloudflare-transfer** is a PowerShell script designed to automate the migration of DNS zones from DNSimple (via the CSC registrar backend) to Cloudflare. It streamlines the process of transferring DNS recordsâ€”keeping your domain registered with CSC while migrating DNS management to Cloudflare. The script adapts records for compatibility, handles URL record processing, updates nameservers, and configures Cloudflare Page Rules programmatically.

## Features

- **Automated DNS Transfers:** Move DNS zones from DNSimple (CSC) to Cloudflare using PowerShell automation.
- **Registrar Independence:** Domains remain with your CSC registrar; only DNS management is transferred.
- **Zone File Parsing:** Adapts DNSimple zone file syntax to be accepted by Cloudflare.
- **URL Record Management:** Splits URL records and creates corresponding Cloudflare Page Rules.
- **API Integration:** Interacts with Cloudflare and CSC APIs for seamless domain and DNS updates.
- **Name Server Management:** Updates CSC nameservers to those provided by Cloudflare automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Retrieve Zone Files:** Fetch zone files for listed domains from DNSimple (CSC backend).
2. **Parse & Convert Records:** Adapt DNS record syntax for Cloudflare and segregate URL records.
3. **Add Domains:** Use Cloudflare API to onboard each domain.
4. **Update Nameservers:** Change CSC nameservers to ones specified by Cloudflare.
5. **Page Rule Automation:** Generate Cloudflare Page Rules for all URL records.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or later (Windows, Mac, or Linux with PowerShell Core) **DISCLAIMER: Sometimes this will NEED Powershell 7 or later. Trial and error required.**
- API access to both Cloudflare and CSC (DNSimple) accounts
- API credentials for Cloudflare and CSC
- Domain list file as expected by the script

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/luckyblake02-svg/cloudflare-transfer.git
   cd cloudflare-transfer
   ```
2. Review dependencies listed at the top of the script (e.g., PowerShell modules).

## Usage

1. **Prepare your domain list:**  
   Format a file with domains as required by the script.

2. **Set up credentials:**  
   Export CSC and Cloudflare API keys as environment variables or update the script configuration section.

3. **Run the script:**  
   ```powershell
   .\cloudflare-transfer.ps1
   ```

   Workflow:
   - Retrieves DNS records from CSC (DNSimple)
   - Adapts records to Cloudflare format
   - Transfers domains/DNS to Cloudflare
   - Updates nameservers on CSC
   - Sets Cloudflare Page Rules for URL records

## Notes

- **Safety:** Domain registration remains with CSC; DNS hosting switches to Cloudflare.
- **Manual Review:** Always double-check custom or complex DNS records after migration.
- **Troubleshooting:** Ensure API credentials are accurate and permissions are sufficient. Run a test migration with a non-production domain if possible.
